"""Skills API — list / upload / delete agent skills (filesystem-backed).

Independent of the documents/RAG library. Upload accepts either a single
SKILL.md or a whole folder (webkitdirectory sends each file with its relative
path); both are rebased to the SKILL.md's directory and funnel through
skill_service.save_skill. Skill content lives on disk, never in the DB.
